## 🚀 Overview

EcoData Hub is a comprehensive environmental laboratory data management system built by Smebye EcoData Insights. Built on React with Material-UI components and powered by Google Cloud services, it provides a modern, scalable solution for managing environmental data from sample collection through analysis and reporting.
